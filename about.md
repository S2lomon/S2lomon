This blog has my name in its domain, so I guess it's about me. Or to be precise it's about topics that I find important or interesting or both.
Due to the fact that through most of my professional life I describe myself as **software engeenier**, it will be mainly about software. 
Other topics that might pop-up could reference, but are not limited to, things like: homeschooling, democratic schools, agile/lean outside IT, attachment parenting and so on.
